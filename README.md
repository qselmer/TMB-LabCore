# TMB-LabCore
TMB-LabCore: A space dedicated to practicing, exploring, and developing skills in TMB programming.

## Description
Each folder contains a TMB example. If both examp.cpp and examp.Rmd exist, then examp is considered a valid example. Each example is associated with a file named examp.expected.RData, which contains the correct output from a reference test machine.
